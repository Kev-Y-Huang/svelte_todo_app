# Kevin Huang CS 279R Svelte/Firebase ToDo app

This is a Svelte/Firebase ToDo app  based on [Jeff Delaney's tutorial](https://fireship.io/lessons/svelte-v3-overview-firebase/).

I implemented changes such that the app now works with Firebase 9 (and its changes with regards to API design).

You can access a version online at [my website](https://kev-y-huang.github.io/svelte_todo_app/).
